# Product Spec: Project Falcon

**Status:** Agreed, version 1.9 (October 18, 2026: graded run 5 measured the quality fixes; changes since version 1.0 are in the Decisions table).

## Overview

Project Falcon is an AI "due diligence team" for M&A deals. A person gives it a deal brief and a set of sources about a target company. A lead agent plans the work, four specialist agents research the sources in parallel, the lead agent connects what they find, an independent checker verifies every important claim, and the person approves the work at three checkpoints. The output is an Investment Committee-ready report.

It is also a portfolio piece. It shows that someone who does not write code can design, control and measure an agentic workflow for high-stakes work. The target company, Talonfield Systems, and all data are fictional.

## Goals

1. Cut the first pass of due diligence from weeks of manual research to one supervised session.
2. Catch the red flags that only appear when sources are combined, such as an event a company left out of its filings.
3. Keep a human in control of every important step, with a clear audit trail.
4. Prove quality with a score, not a claim, by testing against planted red flags.
5. Give hiring managers for AI product manager roles a project they can understand in two minutes and inspect in depth.

## Users

| User | What they do | Sign-in |
|---|---|---|
| **Operator** (deal team analyst or associate; you, for the portfolio) | Starts a run, answers the three checkpoints, reads the report, grades the run | Uses their own Claude Code account. No other sign-in. |
| **Decision maker** (Investment Committee member, deal lead) | Reads the report and decides | None. Receives the PDF. |
| **Portfolio reviewer** (recruiter, hiring manager or interviewer for AI product manager roles) | Reads the README, diagram, sample report and case study | None. Views the public project or the PDF. |

## User stories

**Starting a run**
- As an operator, I can start a full diligence run with one command, so I don't need to remember steps.
- As an operator, I am asked whether to continue or start fresh if a previous run exists, so I never mix two runs by accident.

**Planning and approval**
- As an operator, I see the plan (questions, hypotheses, assignments) before any research starts, so I can correct the scope early.

**Research**
- As an operator, I see which specialists are working and when each one reports, so I know the run is progressing.
- As a decision maker, I can trust that every finding names its source, so I can check anything myself.

**Reviewing red flags**
- As an operator, I see the most serious findings and the conflicts between sources at one stop, so I can decide whether to dig deeper.

**Verification and sign-off**
- As an operator, I see which findings were verified, corrected or rejected before the report is written, so nothing unsupported reaches the committee.

**The report**
- As a decision maker, I get a clear recommendation, the top red flags, answers to the committee's questions and recommended deal protections, so I can decide quickly.
- As a decision maker, I can tell facts from allegations and rumors, so I weigh them correctly.

**Status and audit**
- As an operator, I can ask for the status of a run at any time.
- As anyone reviewing the work, I can read every finding, decision and checkpoint in plain files.

**Grading and re-running**
- As an operator, I can grade a run against the answer key and see what was missed.
- As an operator, I can archive a run and start a clean one.

**Portfolio**
- As a portfolio reviewer, I can understand the problem, the architecture and the results from the README in two minutes.
- As the builder, I keep first-person interview notes that tell the story of the project.

## Functional requirements

**Running a diligence**
- **R1.** One command starts a run. If no previous run exists, it begins with the plan. If one exists, it asks whether to continue or start fresh.
- **R2.** The plan is saved before any research. It maps all six committee questions to specialists, lists 2 to 4 hypotheses, gives each specialist a task list, and states the 3-loop limit.
- **R3.** Checkpoint 1: the run stops after the plan and does nothing until the operator approves or asks for changes.
- **R4.** Four specialists (SEC filings, news and media, litigation, financial) work in parallel. Each reads only its own source.
- **R5.** While specialists work, the operator sees which ones are running and is told when each reports (loading state).
- **R6.** Every finding has an ID, a severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low), a confidence level (High, Medium, Low), a source file and section or row, and a status (Open, Verified, Partially verified, Rejected).
- **R7.** Findings are never deleted. Only their status changes.
- **R8.** Each specialist's full report is saved unedited before it is summarized.
- **R9.** The lead agent compares sources and records cross-source findings, conflicts, disclosure gaps and stale assumptions. When three or more findings describe the same trend, it combines them into one cross-source finding. Every customer, supplier or litigant named in a source is sized against the customer revenue data.
- **R10.** The research loop runs at most 3 times. Every extra loop is logged with its reason.
- **R11.** Checkpoint 2: the run stops and shows a table of Critical and High findings, the main conflicts and what is still open. It waits for "proceed" or "dig deeper on <topic>".
- **R12.** An independent checker verifies every Critical and High finding and every Medium finding that an IC answer cites or a cross-source finding is built from (at least three Medium findings in all), and gives each a verdict. Every correction for a Partially verified finding is applied to the register before Checkpoint 3.
- **R13.** Findings judged Not supported are kept in the register but left out of the report.
- **R14.** Checkpoint 3: the run stops and shows the verification results and the draft recommendation. It waits for approval.
- **R15.** The report has nine parts: cover, executive summary, answers to the six questions, risk matrix, workstream detail, cross-source insights, deal protections, open questions, appendix. The executive summary includes the main positive and mitigating points. The appendix includes an index of verified findings and a list of the findings that were not verified, each labeled "not verified".
- **R16.** The report is saved as Markdown, as a web page and, when the computer has a PDF tool, as a PDF. Without a PDF tool, the operator is told how to save the web page as a PDF (error state).

**Status, grading and reset**
- **R17.** A status command shows the current step, loops used, findings by severity and status, and the top open questions. With no run, it says so (empty state).
- **R18.** A grading command scores the latest run: recall overall and for Critical and High issues, severity accuracy, unsupported findings and distractors rated too high, using one fixed grading rule so every run is scored the same way. It asks permission before opening the answer key. With no run, it tells the operator to run a diligence first (empty state).
- **R19.** A reset command archives the current run and its scorecard with a date and time, and restores blank working memory. It never changes the sources, the answer key or the setup.

**Safety and quality**
- **R20.** The agents cannot use the web and cannot change source files.
- **R21.** The specialists can only read files.
- **R22.** Allegations and rumors are always labeled as such.
- **R23.** If a specialist fails or returns findings without sources, the lead agent asks again once. If that fails, the gap is recorded as an open question (error state).
- **R24.** If a source file is missing or empty, the specialist reports it under "Files reviewed" and as a gap (error state).
- **R25.** All outputs use plain English, US$ millions with one decimal place, and no em dashes.
- **R29.** The agents cannot open anything in `evaluation/` (the answer key and the latest scorecard) or an earlier run (`examples/`, `runs/`) unless the operator approves, so a new run stays blind.

**Portfolio**
- **R26.** The project includes a README with the problem, the architecture diagram, how a run works, sample results and how to run it.
- **R27.** The project includes a complete sample run: working memory, report PDF and scorecard.
- **R28.** The project keeps `interview-notes.md` in first person, updated after significant features, major bug fixes and meaningful design changes.

## Layout and responsiveness

- **Desktop:** runs happen in Claude Code in a terminal. Checkpoint messages fit in a normal terminal window, with tables of no more than 5 columns.
- **Report (PDF):** US Letter, portrait, printable in color or black and white. Tables repeat their header row across pages.
- **Report (web page):** readable on a phone. Text reflows, and wide tables scroll sideways instead of shrinking.
- **README and diagram:** read well on GitHub on desktop and phone. The diagram is legible when zoomed on a phone.

## Out of scope for v1

- Live connections to real sources (SEC EDGAR, news services, court systems, data rooms).
- Real client or real company data.
- A custom web app or dashboard.
- Several people working on one run at the same time.
- A full valuation model (for example a discounted cash flow model).
- Legal, accounting or investment advice.
- Scheduled or continuous monitoring of a target.

## Future features (and what v1 does to leave room)

| Future feature | What v1 does now |
|---|---|
| Real sources through connectors | Each source sits behind one specialist and one folder, so a source can be swapped without changing the others. |
| More specialists (tax, people, IP, ESG) | Every specialist uses the same finding format and rubrics. |
| Several deals at once | The deal brief is a single file, and each run is archived separately. |
| Excel data pack for the committee | Key numbers are already collected in one working dataset. |
| Better scores over time | The grading command and answer key make improvements measurable. |

## Success criteria (checkable by using it)

1. An operator can finish a full run with three replies (approve, proceed, approve report) in under 90 minutes.
2. Every run stops at all three checkpoints and does nothing until the operator replies.
3. The report contains all nine parts, and every finding in it names a source.
4. Grading the sample run shows: at least 80% recall on Critical and High issues, zero unsupported findings in the report, and zero distractors rated Medium or above. (Default targets.)
5. No source file changes during a run.
6. A reviewer can explain the project after two minutes with the README.

## Decisions

| Date | Decision |
|---|---|
| 2026-10-17 | Build with Claude Code features only. No Agent SDK and no application code. |
| 2026-10-17 | Use Claude Code rather than Cowork or Managed Agents (control, readability, and the data-retention options for real client data). |
| 2026-10-18 | Use a fictional public company (Talonfield Systems) with simulated sources and planted red flags. |
| 2026-10-18 | Organize specialists by source to match the architecture: SEC filings, news, litigation, financials. |
| 2026-10-18 | Three mandatory human checkpoints and a 3-loop limit. |
| 2026-10-18 | Add an independent citation checker and an answer key with a grading command. |
| 2026-10-18 | Keep first-person interview notes for the project story. |
| 2026-10-18 | `interview-notes.md` stays private. A `.gitignore` rule keeps it out of GitHub. |
| 2026-10-18 | The portfolio lives in the GitHub repository `sabinejoseph8/Falcon_M-A_Due_Diligence`, plus the one-page case study PDF for applications. |
| 2026-10-18 | Show results with their limits up front: the scorecard and README say how blind the first test run was. |
| 2026-10-18 | After the first grading: the report appendix lists findings that were not verified, trend findings are combined, and verifier corrections are applied before Checkpoint 3 (R9, R12, R15). |
| 2026-10-18 | Earlier runs are protected like the answer key, so a new run stays blind (R29). |
| 2026-10-18 | Time target for a full run raised from 45 to 90 minutes (success criterion 1): the first test run took 69 minutes from the approved plan to sign-off, plus about 10 minutes for the report. Faster runs are a later improvement. |
| 2026-10-18 | The portfolio is aimed at AI product manager roles. The README, case study and interview story lead with product skills: framing the problem, specs and a phased plan, evaluation, safety and iteration. The M&A depth is the proof of domain judgment. |
| 2026-10-18 | Each run's scorecard is archived with the run, and everything in `evaluation/` needs approval to open, so one run's grade cannot leak into the next run or be overwritten by the next grading (R19, R29). |
| 2026-10-18 | Fully blind run graded. It meets success criteria 2 to 5: all three checkpoints held (an early "approve" was logged but not treated as sign-off), all nine report parts, 96.2% recall on Critical and High issues, 0 unsupported findings, 0 distractors too high, no source file changed. Criterion 1 (under 90 minutes) was not measured fairly: elapsed time was about 7 hours, mostly gaps between operator replies and one stalled turn, so timing needs a cleaner measurement next run. |
| 2026-10-18 | Three blind graded runs with a frozen setup meet success criterion 4 every time: Critical and High recall 96.2%, 96.2% and 100% (average 97.4%), 0 unsupported findings and 0 distractors too high in each. |
| 2026-10-18 | Fixes from the graded runs (R9, R12, R15): size every named counterparty against the customer data, verify the Medium findings the report relies on, put positives and mitigating points in the executive summary, and calibrate debt severity. `/evaluate` gets one fixed grading rule (R18). They take effect from the next run and have not been measured yet. |
| 2026-10-18 | Graded run 4, the first with the fixes, meets success criteria 2 to 5: 100% recall on all 18 planted issues and on the 13 Critical and High issues, 100% severity accuracy, 0 unsupported findings, 0 distractors too high. Every repeated gap from runs 1 to 3 closed (R9, R12, R15). One run only, so no range yet. Next quality fixes, held for now: severity drift toward Critical, a self-check of cross-source findings, folding duplicate findings. |
| 2026-10-18 | Quality fixes from run 4 (R9, R11, R12, R15): Critical needs a named test and the number that meets it; the lead agent self-checks its cross-source findings; duplicates are folded into a parent finding so the risk matrix shows each fact once. Not yet measured; graded run 5 will check that recall holds and quality improves. |
| 2026-10-18 | Graded run 5, with the quality fixes, meets success criteria 3 to 5 and every quality target: 100% recall on the 13 Critical and High issues (97.2% on all 18), 100% severity accuracy, 0 unsupported findings, 0 distractors too high, 3 Critical issues, 5 of 14 cross-source findings corrected, a 14-row risk matrix and a 17-page report. Criterion 2 held only in part: the run stopped at all three checkpoints, but the Checkpoint 1 plan summary was not shown in chat. Fixed after the run (R3, R16): checkpoint content is printed before the question, and the report converter is committed. |
