# Mergers and Acquisitions due diligence

**Project Falcon:** a multi-agent M&A due diligence system, built in Claude Code.

> **Portfolio case study.** An AI "diligence team" that researches an acquisition target across SEC filings, news, litigation records and financial data, then writes an Investment Committee report.
>
> All companies, people, court cases, articles and numbers are **fictional**.

## At a glance

- **The task:** due diligence on Talonfield Systems, a (fictional) public robotics company that Arbelion Industries wants to buy for $24.00 per share (about $1.16 billion).
- **The team:** one lead agent and five specialist subagents, running a bounded **Plan -> Act -> Observe** loop.
- **The controls:** three mandatory human checkpoints, read-only specialists, an independent citation verifier, an iteration cap and blocked web access.
- **The proof:** the fictional data contains 18 planted red flags. A built-in answer key and an `/evaluate` command grade how many the system finds.
- **Built like a product:** a product spec, design spec, tech spec and phased plan, each agreed before building, with automated checks for every phase.
- **Results:** across three fully blind graded runs, each in a fresh session that never saw the answer key, the system averaged 97.4% recall on the 13 Critical and High planted issues (range 96.2% to 100%) and 93.5% on all 18, with no unsupported finding in any report and no distractor rated too high. A fourth blind run, after fixing the gaps those three exposed, found all 18 (100%). A fifth, after quality fixes, kept 100% on Critical and High issues while cutting the report from 38 pages to 17 and the risk matrix from 90 rows to 14. A sixth found all 18 again, in a 13-page report. An earlier, partly blind test run is kept as a [sample](examples/sample-run/evaluation/scorecard.md). On two new fictional targets it still found every planted issue's facts and put nothing unsupported in a report; on the one built blind it found all 18, and exact severity judgment (77.8%) was the gap (see [Does it generalize?](#does-it-generalize-two-new-targets)).

## The problem

During M&A due diligence, teams must research target companies across multiple databases, public filings, news, litigation history and financial records. This open-ended investigation can take weeks for teams of 5 to 10 associates. Autonomous agents can help, but they are the hardest AI pattern to control, so high-stakes work needs human checkpoints.

## How the architecture maps to Claude Code

| Architecture component | Built with | Files |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent Core** (Plan -> Act -> Observe) | Lead agent instructions | `CLAUDE.md` |
| **SEC Filing Search** | Subagent + simulated filings | `.claude/agents/sec-filings-analyst.md`, `targets/<target>/data/sec-filings/` |
| **News & Media API** | Subagent + simulated news feed | `.claude/agents/news-media-analyst.md`, `targets/<target>/data/news/` |
| **Litigation Database** | Subagent + simulated court dockets | `.claude/agents/litigation-analyst.md`, `targets/<target>/data/litigation/` |
| **Financial Analysis** | Subagent + financial data | `.claude/agents/financial-analyst.md`, `targets/<target>/data/financials/` |
| **Working Memory** (findings, datasets) | A folder of Markdown files | `memory/` |
| **Comprehensive Due Diligence Report** | Report step with a print stylesheet, a committed converter and headless Chrome for the PDF | `output/`, `templates/report-style.css`, `tools/md2html.py` |
| **Human-in-the-loop checkpoints** | Three mandatory stops | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Added: quality control | Independent citation verifier | `.claude/agents/citation-verifier.md` |
| Added: guardrails | Permission rules (no web, read-only data) | `.claude/settings.json` |
| Added: evaluation | Answer key per target and grading command | `targets/<target>/evaluation/`, `/evaluate` |
| Added: one-word commands | Slash commands | `.claude/commands/` |

## How a run works

1. **Plan.** The lead agent reads the deal brief, maps the Investment Committee's six questions to the analysts, writes hypotheses and a task list to `memory/plan.md`. **Checkpoint 1: a human approves the plan.**
2. **Act.** Four specialists work in parallel, each on its own source, and return findings in a standard format: ID, evidence, source, severity, confidence and what to cross-check.
3. **Observe.** The lead agent records every finding in the findings register, then compares sources. Most of the serious issues only appear here: a court ruling the company's filing leaves out, a one-off revenue amount from a footnote that changes the growth story, a deal model built on guidance that was later cut. It loops again only if a Critical or High question is still open (maximum 3 loops). **Checkpoint 2: a human reviews the red flags and decides whether to dig deeper.**
4. **Verify.** An independent citation verifier re-opens every cited source and re-checks every Critical and High finding. **Checkpoint 3: a human signs off.**
5. **Report.** The lead agent writes the report: a recommendation, the top red flags, answers to the six IC questions, a risk matrix, cross-source insights, deal protections and a management request list.

## Design choices

- **Specialists by source, not by topic.** This mirrors the architecture's tools and forces the important work, connecting sources, into the lead agent's Observe step.
- **Separation of duties.** Analysts cannot edit anything. A separate verifier checks their work, like a reviewer on a real deal team.
- **Severity and confidence are separate.** A rumor can matter a lot and still be unconfirmed. The report labels facts, allegations and rumors.
- **Memory as plain files.** Anyone can open `memory/` and audit every finding, decision and checkpoint. The run survives a restart.
- **Bounded autonomy.** A 3-loop cap, stop conditions and human checkpoints keep the agents on a short leash.
- **Measured, not assumed.** Planted issues and an answer key turn "it seems to work" into a score you can improve.

## How it was planned and tested

- **Project Memory:** the [product spec](Project%20Memory/product-spec.md) (28 requirements), [design spec](Project%20Memory/design.md), [tech spec](Project%20Memory/tech-spec.md) (architecture, data model and 11 critical risks) and the phased [plan](Project%20Memory/progress.md), each agreed before building. They are also published as a [website](https://claude.ai/artifact/CmFqn6PUnPvRse4GxpLrDW) with live plan ticks.
- **Automated checks:** 49 checks using only Python's standard library, for every phase: read-only agents and guardrails, data that ties out and has not changed (for every target), complete runs and reports, graded scorecards and house style. Type `/run-tests`, or run `python3 tests/run_all.py`. Add `--run examples/sample-run` to check the saved run.
- **One-page case study:** [docs/case-study.pdf](docs/case-study.pdf).

## Sample run

A complete test run from October 18, 2026 is saved in [`examples/sample-run/`](examples/sample-run/).

**Proposed recommendation: do not proceed at $24.00 per share.** At the deal model's own multiple, current guidance supports $12.60 to $14.50 per share. The three Critical issues: a valuation built on guidance the target had already replaced, a patent case that turned against the target (with an injunction sought on robots behind about 42% of revenue), and a 31% customer that can leave after a change of control. Read the [report (PDF, 15 pages)](examples/sample-run/output/Project-Falcon-Due-Diligence-Report.pdf).

| Step | What happened |
|---|---|
| Plan | 6 IC questions and 4 hypotheses; approved at Checkpoint 1 |
| Iteration 1 | 4 analysts in parallel: 59 findings. The lead agent added 15 cross-source findings and 5 conflicts between sources |
| Iteration 2 | 5 narrow follow-ups (covenant headroom, what the 10-Q leaves out, normalized revenue and valuation): 15 more findings |
| Verify | 61 findings re-checked by 4 verifier runs in parallel: 44 verified, 17 corrected, 0 rejected |
| Report | Approved at Checkpoint 3. 69 minutes from plan to sign-off; 10 subagent runs; about 1.95 million subagent tokens |

**Scorecard** (graded with `/evaluate` against the answer key):

| Metric | Result | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Recall, the 13 Critical and High planted issues | 100% | at least 80% |
| Recall, all 18 planted issues | 97.2% (17 found, 1 partially found) | |
| Severity within one level of the answer key | 100% | |
| Unsupported findings in the report | 0 | 0 |
| Distractors rated Medium or above | 0 of 4 | 0 |

**What the evaluation changed.** The one partial miss (goodwill impairment risk) was found by three agents but never reached the report, because only higher-severity findings were verified. That, a trend spread across five findings and verifier corrections applied late became three fixes to `CLAUDE.md`, applied after this run.

**How blind was it?** The analysts and verifiers never saw the answer key. The lead agent ran in the same Claude Code session that built the data, and the checkpoints were approved by the builder. The three graded runs below fix that: each ran in a fresh session.

**Three blind graded runs.** After the three fixes, I ran the system three more times, each in a fresh Claude Code session that never saw the answer key or an earlier run. The setup was frozen across the three, so the scores measure how much results vary from run to run.

| Metric | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Average | Range |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Recall, the 13 Critical and High planted issues | 96.2% | 96.2% | 100% | 97.4% | 96.2% to 100% |
| Recall, all 18 planted issues | 94.4% | 91.7% | 94.4% | 93.5% | 91.7% to 94.4% |
| Severity within one level of the answer key | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | |
| Unsupported findings in the report | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | |
| Distractors rated Medium or above | 0 of 4 | 0 of 4 | 0 of 4 | 0 | |

The same gaps showed up more than once: goodwill impairment risk was only partly found in all three runs, the planted positives were thin in every report, and a lawsuit by the #4 customer was not linked to that customer's revenue in two of the three. Those became the next instruction fixes. Run 2's own scorecard reports 96.4% because it counted 14 Critical and High issues; the table recomputes every run on the answer key's 13. Scorecards: [run 1](runs/2026-10-18_0921/evaluation/scorecard.md), [run 2](runs/2026-10-18_1336/evaluation/scorecard.md), [run 3](runs/2026-10-18_1741/evaluation/scorecard.md).

**Run 4: measuring the fixes.** I then applied the fixes the three runs pointed to and gave `/evaluate` a fixed grading rule:

- size every named customer, supplier or litigant against the customer data;
- verify every Medium finding the report relies on;
- put the strengths in the executive summary;
- compare the last goodwill test with the share price since.

Then I ran a fourth blind run in a fresh session.

| Metric | Runs 1 to 3 (average) | Run 4 (with fixes) |
|---|---|---|
| Recall, the 13 Critical and High planted issues | 97.4% | 100% |
| Recall, all 18 planted issues | 93.5% | 100% |
| Severity within one level of the answer key | 100% | 100% |
| Unsupported findings in the report | 0 | 0 |
| Distractors rated Medium or above | 0 | 0 |

All three repeated gaps closed:

- Pinecrest is now sized as the #4 customer ($17.4M).
- The LiDAR and tariff risk is combined across sources and verified.
- Goodwill risk is tied to the share price fall and verified.
- Strengths have their own section in the executive summary.

**Caveats.** This is one run with the fixes, not an average, so it shows the fixes work, not how much the result varies. Run 4 was graded in the session that produced it, which is the same practice as runs 1 to 3.

**The next problems are about quality, not recall:**
- Severity drift: three High issues were rated Critical.
- The verifier corrected 9 of the lead agent's 19 cross-source findings.
- A 90-row risk matrix full of duplicates.

Scorecard: [run 4](runs/2026-10-18_1909/evaluation/scorecard.md).

**Run 5: measuring the quality fixes.** I made three changes for quality, not recall: a Critical rating must name the test it meets and show the number; the lead agent self-checks each cross-source finding before verification; and duplicate findings are folded into one parent finding, so the risk matrix shows each fact once. Then I ran a fifth blind run in a fresh session.

| Metric | Run 4 | Run 5 (quality fixes) |
|---|---|---|
| Recall, the 13 Critical and High planted issues | 100% | 100% |
| Recall, all 18 planted issues | 100% | 97.2% |
| Severity within one level of the answer key | 100% | 100% |
| Unsupported findings in the report | 0 | 0 |
| Distractors rated Medium or above | 0 | 0 |
| Critical issues in the report | 11 labels | 3 |
| Cross-source findings the verifier corrected | 9 of 19 | 5 of 14 |
| Risk matrix rows | 90 | 14 |
| Report length | 38 pages | 17 pages |

Every quality target was met, and Critical and High recall held. The cost was half a point on goodwill risk: it was found again, but as a Medium finding that no answer cited, so it was never verified. The run also showed three process gaps, all fixed afterwards: the Checkpoint 1 plan summary was not shown in chat, one verifier's headline count did not match its own table, and the run wrote its own report converter, which is now committed as `tools/md2html.py`.

Scorecard: [run 5](runs/2026-10-18_2316/evaluation/scorecard.md).

**Run 6: closing the last gap.** Run 5 lost half a point on goodwill because a Medium finding that no answer cited was never verified. Two general changes followed: verify every Medium finding the report shows, and compare each dated accounting judgment (an impairment test, a reserve) with what happened afterwards. They were written by a builder session that had never opened the answer key. Then I ran a sixth blind run.

| Metric | Run 5 | Run 6 |
|---|---|---|
| Recall, the 13 Critical and High planted issues | 100% | 100% |
| Recall, all 18 planted issues | 97.2% | 100% |
| Severity within one level of the answer key | 100% | 100% |
| Unsupported findings in the report | 0 | 0 |
| Distractors rated Medium or above | 0 | 0 |
| Cross-source findings the verifier corrected | 5 of 14 | 7 of 13 |
| Risk matrix rows | 14 | 18 |
| Report length | 17 pages | 13 pages |

Goodwill risk was tied to events after the test date and verified, so all 18 issues are found again. The run 5 process fixes held: every checkpoint was shown in chat, and the report used the committed converter. Two small things slipped: the verifier corrected more cross-source findings, and six unverified Low findings got a non-standard status, which one automated check flags.

Scorecard: [run 6](runs/2026-10-19_0903/evaluation/scorecard.md).

Inside the run: the [findings register](examples/sample-run/memory/findings.md), the [run log](examples/sample-run/memory/run-log.md) with all three checkpoints, every analyst's [unedited report](examples/sample-run/memory/analyst-reports/), the [verifier reports](examples/sample-run/memory/verification/) and the [scorecard](examples/sample-run/evaluation/scorecard.md).

## Does it generalize? Two new targets

Six runs on one dataset can overstate how good a system is, because its instructions were tuned on that data. So I tested it on two new fictional targets, each in its own folder under `targets/`, graded the same way.

- **Kestrel** (a clinical-lab company in a private equity take-private) was built by a session that never saw Falcon's answers. But it could read the system's instructions, and most of its planted issues turned out to be the same types as Falcon's, so it is a near-transfer test.
- **Heron** (a smart-home company) was built by a session that never saw the instructions or the other targets, from issue types neither of the others uses: product safety, a pension cash call on change of control, a privacy order, disputed patent ownership, sanctions, transfer pricing and more. It is the held-out test, and the setup was frozen until it was graded.

| Metric | Falcon run 6 (tuned) | Kestrel run 1 (near transfer) | Heron (held out) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Planted issues whose facts were found | 18 of 18 | 18 of 18 (one only as a note) | 18 of 18 |
| Recall, the 13 Critical and High issues | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Recall, all 18 issues | 100% | 97.2% | 100% |
| Severity within one level of the answer key | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| Severity, exact match | not measured | not measured | 77.8% (14 of 18) |
| Unsupported findings in the report | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Distractors rated Medium or above | 0 of 4 | 2 of 4 | 1 of 4 |

**How to read Heron's score.** The system found the facts of every planted issue on a target it had never seen, and put nothing unsupported in the report. Scores use the grading rule the owner chose: an issue counts as found when its main point is verified with a severity within one level of what the answer key accepts, and exact severity matches are reported separately. On that rule Heron is 100% recall, with 14 of 18 severities (77.8%) an exact match; four were one level off (for example a product-safety issue rated High instead of Critical). Heron's original grader used a stricter reading that counted those four as partly found (88.5% on Critical and High issues); the rule was made exact afterwards so every run is graded the same way. What did not carry over cleanly is judgment: exact severity on unfamiliar issue types, and one distractor (pre-planned share sales by the CFO) rated as a red flag.

**What happened after each grade.** After Kestrel run 1 and after Heron, new rules were added from their scorecards (commits `af02fce` and `78827d5`). A Kestrel rerun with those rules scored 100% with 0 distractors too high, but that is an in-sample result, measured on the target the rules came from, so it does not count as generalization. The honest test of the new rules is a fourth target built blind.

Scorecards: [Kestrel run 1](runs/2026-10-19_1449/evaluation/scorecard.md), [Kestrel rerun, in-sample](runs/2026-10-19_1614/evaluation/scorecard.md), [Heron](runs/2026-10-19_1711/evaluation/scorecard.md).

## Run it yourself

Open the folder in Claude Code and type `/diligence` (or `/diligence <target>` for a target other than `falcon`). Reply at the three checkpoints. Full guide: [docs/how-to-run.md](docs/how-to-run.md).

For a truly blind test, start a fresh Claude Code session in the folder, run `/diligence`, then `/evaluate` and compare your scorecard with the sample run. Claude Code asks before any agent can open the answer key, a scorecard or an earlier run.

## From demo to a real deal

- Replace the simulated folders with real sources: filings downloaded from SEC EDGAR, a news feed or news connector, court records (for example docket exports), and the virtual data room.
- Connect internal systems through admin-approved, read-only connectors, and confirm data handling terms (for example plan type and data retention) with your firm's IT and compliance teams before using client data.
- Keep the human checkpoints. They are the point.

## Limitations

- The simulated data is cleaner and smaller than a real data room.
- In the sample run, the human checkpoints were approved by the builder, not by an Investment Committee member, and the lead agent ran in the session that built the data. Only the analysts and verifiers were blind.
- AI output can still be wrong. The verifier reduces errors but does not remove the need for expert review.
- Nothing here is investment, legal or accounting advice.

## Skills demonstrated

- **AI product management:** framing the problem and the users, product, design and tech specs, a phased plan with acceptance tests, success metrics set up front, and product changes driven by measured results.
- **Evaluation:** planted ground truth (18 issues and 4 distractors), a blind answer key, recall and severity scoring, an independent verifier, and honest reporting of the test's limits.
- **Agentic workflow design:** multi-agent orchestration, bounded autonomy, human-in-the-loop checkpoints, least-privilege guardrails and prompt-injection defense.
- **Domain depth (M&A due diligence):** revenue quality, cash conversion, EBITDA add-backs, covenant analysis, litigation exposure, disclosure gaps, governance and deal protections.
- **Communication:** an Investment Committee-ready report, a one-page case study and a clear audit trail.
